    "for each point along the generated Dubins path, considering both **curvature** and **acceleration limits**.\n",

    "The algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "1. **Curvature Calculation** — Estimates curvature (`kappa`) from yaw changes along the path.  \n",
    "2. **Lateral Acceleration Limit** — Computes the maximum feasible speed around curves.  \n",
    "3. **Backward Pass** — Ensures safe **deceleration** when approaching curves or stops.  \n",
    "4. **Forward Pass** — Ensures safe **acceleration** without exceeding longitudinal limits.  \n",
    "5. **Velocity Assignment** — Combines results into a list of (x, y, yaw, v_ref) tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it generates the `FullDubinsV` list at a maximum target speed of **150 km/h** with realistic dynamic constraints.\n"
